In this repository you will find projects that I've created on my own or in a team.
I will be constantly updating this repository with more and more code, as I grow as a programmer.
While my code may seem easy or wrong, I am constantly improving and learning from my experiences.
Even if I wouldn't write programs in the way I did previously, they are a part of my development history, that is why I won't edit my older projects.
I hope you find my projects interesting or at the very least funny, as programming is something i do because it is extremely fun :)
